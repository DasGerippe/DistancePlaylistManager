# Distance Playlist Manager

A tool for the racing game Distance that offers advanced playlist management features.

## Current Features

- Create a playlist with the levels from a workshop collection.

## Planned Features

- Add levels from a workshop collection to an existing playlist.
- Randomize levels in a playlist.
- Remove duplicate levels from a playlist.
- Simple playlist management:
  - create new
  - copy
  - rename
  - delete
- Advanced playlist management (probably implemented with a GUI):
  - Add or insert levels to a playlist.
  - Remove levels from a playlist.
  - Manually order levels in a playlist.
- GUI

I'm also open to feature requests, though I wont promise implementing any of the requested or planned features.
